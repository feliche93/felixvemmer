A few months ago, I came across a blog post by [Luka](https://twitter.com/_lhermann), titled [Bootstrapping a SaaS Business in Germany: How I did it](https://lukashermann.dev/writing/bootstrapping-a-saas-business-in-germany/). I found it particularly insightful as there are only a few German IndieHackers who share targeted, useful content for their peers.

Inspired by this, I decided to share my own journey towards becoming an IT freelancer in Germany. My hope is that this will guide and inspire others contemplating a similar path.
