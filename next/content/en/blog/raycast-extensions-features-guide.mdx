Welcome to my comprehensive guide on [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), a crucial tool in my daily stack that supercharges my productivity by allowing me to control my mac with just a few keystrokes. Raycast is brilliantly designed to integrate with the apps and services I use every day, enabling me to execute actions faster than ever before.

In this guide, I will share my experience exploring the key features of Raycast, diving into its most useful extensions, and comparing it with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), another productivity tool I've used. This guide is particularly beneficial for Mac users, as Raycast is currently not available for Windows. Whether you're a beginner or a power user like me, this guide has insights for you. So, let's dive into the world of Raycast and discover how it can revolutionize your workflow as it has mine.

## Key Features of Raycast

Raycast is packed with a multitude of features designed to streamline your workflow and boost your productivity. From quick actions to powerful scripting, Raycast offers a range of capabilities that make it a standout tool in my productivity stack. In this section, I'll delve into some of the key features that make Raycast a game-changer for me.

### Window Management

Once you've launched an app, Raycast allows you to manage its windows with ease. You can quickly switch between windows, close windows, and even move windows to different desktops. This feature is particularly useful for managing multiple windows on large screens.

Here is my setup for window management, which allows me to place windows on thirds and two-thirds of the screen:

/>

### Snippets

Raycast allows you to create snippets for text that you use frequently. You type in a short keyword, and Raycast will expand it into the full text.

You can create snippets for anything from email addresses to code snippets. This feature is particularly useful for saving time when you're typing the same text over and over again.

Here are some of my personal snippet examples:

```bash
# My Cal.com Link
!cal - https://cal.com/felix-vemmer/30-minute-google-hangout-chat

# My VAT number
!vat - DE359100888

# Backlink GPT Domain
!bg - backlinkgpt.com

# Lemon Squeezy Affiliate Link for BacklinkGPT
!lmaf - https://backlinkgpt.lemonsqueezy.com/affiliates
```

### Clipboard History

I have set up Raycast to access my clipboard history using the shortcut `⌥ + c` on my Mac. This feature has proven to be incredibly useful when I'm juggling multiple copy-paste operations.

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  width="1351"

  src="/posts/raycast-extensions-features-guide/clipboard-history.gif"
/>

It also includes a powerful search functionality, which allows me to quickly locate and retrieve any item from my clipboard history.

### Launching Apps

Raycast allows you to launch apps with just a few keystrokes. You can launch apps by typing their name or by using a custom keyword. For example, I can launch [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) by typing `cursor` or by using the keyword `cur`. This feature is particularly useful for launching apps that don't have a keyboard shortcut or are buried in your dock.

### File Search€

I have set up Raycast to search for files and folders using the shortcut `⌥ + d` on my Mac. This simple yet powerful feature allows me to view metadata and perform common actions on the files. It has proven to be incredibly useful for finding files that are buried deep in my file system.

/>

### Emoji Picker

Probably not the most critical feature but still very useful when you need to add an emoji to a message or document. I have set up Raycast to access the emoji picker using the shortcut `⌥ + e` on my Mac.

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  width="800"

/>

There is also a [GIF Search Extension](https://www.raycast.com/josephschmitt/gif-search) that allows you to search for GIFs and copy them to your clipboard.

### Quick Links and Bookmarks

Whenever I have to login to my Datev Duo Account for Tax Accounting, I used to google it every time. Now, with Raycast I can set up a quicklink to login to my Datev Duo Account with just a few keystrokes.

### Jumping into Online Meetings

Never miss another meeting with Raycast. It allows you to join Zoom, Google Hangouts and more, without the need to search for a link. You can jump straight into your calls or check your upcoming schedule. When a meeting is selected, simply hit Enter to open up the meeting URL in the browser.

## ChatGPT & Raycast Pro

In May 2023, Raycast launched [Raycast Pro](https://www.raycast.com/pro), a subscription service that unlocks a range of powerful features.

<Tweet id="1656197167072309250" />

At the Core of Raycast Pro is ChatGPT:

> Write smarter, code faster and answer questions quicker with ChatGPT in Raycast. Deeply integrated into macOS and just one keystroke away.

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  width="1351"

  src="/posts/raycast-extensions-features-guide/ai-content-3.eda1b002.png"
/>

Raycast Pro is a subscription service that unlocks a new level of your personal productivity for $10 per month.

What’s included in Raycast Pro:

- Everything in Free
- Raycast AI
- Cloud Sync
- Custom Themes
- Unlimited Clipboard History

For an additional $10 per month, you can also get GPT-4 included.

  src="/posts/raycast-extensions-features-guide/pricing-plan.png"
/>

Personally, I think the pricing is fair especially with the GPT-4 integration you end up at the same price as paying for ChatGPT directly.

However, I have not yet subscribed to Raycast Pro. I am keen on trying out the new ChatGPT Pro features as they are released. Moreover, for tasks related to coding, I personally believe that using [cursor](https://www.cursor.so) provides a superior developer experience.
