Ever since I have been greenpilled to use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), I have been hooked on the AI features in the [Pro version](https://www.raycast.com/pro). I was sceptical on the value prop, thinking it's just another llm-api-wrapper but now it's the NUMBER ONE useful thing I pay for. 

As teasered with this tweet I wanted to go with this blogpost more in depth and showcase how I use raycast pro every day.

## Raycast Intro 

Raycast is a powerful productivity tool designed for macOS that serves as a customizable launcher app, enhancing the user's workflow by providing a centralized platform for various tasks. It offers a wide range of features that can be tailored to individual needs, making it a versatile tool for managing daily tasks efficiently.

## Raycast Pro

The main difference between Raycast and [Raycast Pro](https://www.raycast.com/pro) lies in the additional features and capabilities that the Pro version offers. Raycast Pro is designed for individuals and includes features such as:

- Raycast AI
- Cloud Sync
- Custom Themes
- Unlimited Clipboard History
- Translator

The Team plan is for organizations and offers all Pro features, plus the ability for teams to share extensions and more.

### Pricing and Value

The pricing of Raycast Pro is a [topic of discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/raycastapp/comments/17tmnk1/your_thoughts_on_raycast_pro/), with some users finding the $8 per month (or $96 per year) to be expensive for the additional features. However, others feel that the benefits of Raycast AI and Cloud Sync make the subscription worthwhile, especially for those who use the app extensively. The value of Raycast Pro ultimately depends on the individual's needs and how they utilize the app in their workflow.

Personally, I think the value is well worth the cost, especially for using AI in my workflows so easily. As I will show down below some of my most common workflows for Raycast, I can see the benefits of the Pro plan.

## Raycast AI

Raycast AI is a key feature of the Pro plan, allowing users to harness the power of AI directly within their operating system. It offers a range of AI models all under one subscription, including:

Recently Raycast also added the image models Dall-E 2 and Dall-E 3, which are great for creating images.

Yeah for sure so in the beginning I was sceptical on the value prop, thinking it's just another llm-api-wrapper but now it's the NUMBER ONE useful thing I pay for. Here's why:

1️⃣. Access to tons of models under one sub: GPT-4, Claude Opus 3, Perplexity Sonar, Llama 70b via Groq.

So the really cool thing here is depending on the task you can pick the perfect model, e.g.:

Translate Markdown blogpost: Llama 70b via Groq. So fast and also smart enough to handle good translation. GPT-4 and Claude Opus 3 are just waay to slow.

Write parts of my blogpost: Opus3, I just like the writing style much more than GPT-4.

Research any facutal info or get recommendaitons, e.g. best beaches mallorca, Sonar just gives fantastic results.

2️⃣. With AI Actions you can just create some super powerful shortcuts to get repetitive things automated. What I really like about AI commands are the dynamic placeholders where you can add variables as:

selected text, clipboard text, argument, or even a focused browser tab.

I have several actions that save me tons of time:

- E.g. freelance requests without budget, or key info (here I just execute the command and get a nice reply that's personalized yet, requests all key info)

- Improve/Reply Emails with bullets (I use 
@SparkMailApp
 but don't like their AI, so I just select the text, provide a few bullets and get super good reply

3️⃣. I am quite bullish and excited about 
@raycastapp
 's mobile app. I think will be a killer to have access to the AI features on iOS, but yeah that's more to come!
